The jquery.Formbuilder plugin is a script that allows you integrate
a jquery and php based form-creation tool into your application.

The interface is built by the jquery plugin based off of an xml response provided
by the server. The php class assists you with storing the data,
generating the xml, generating the html form, and processing the data.
